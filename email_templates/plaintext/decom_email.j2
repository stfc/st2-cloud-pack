Dear Cloud User {{username}}

As you may be aware the STFC Cloud is decommissioning Virtual Machines with the following Flavors:

{{affected_flavors_table}}

This largely due to the age of the hardware hosting these Virtual Machines, and the fact that the data centre space
we recover from these hosts can be used for new, more dense, hardware.

<p>This decommissioning has been in progress for a number of months and has progressed well so far but we
now need to get in touch with all of you who still have C flavor VMs individually regarding next steps.

In short, this hardware needs to be decommissioned as soon as possible, as such your VM(s) (details below)
must be either migrated to new hardware, replaced with newly created VMs, or deleted as soon as possible.

(Note: we understand that our User Communities often create VMs on behalf of others, this communication is based on
the individual who created the machine in the STFC Cloud. In this case delegate as needed to your colleagues and
collaborators)

The document linked below detail the steps you can take to migrate your VMs using the resize process:<br>

Where possible we will not decommission hardware that is still hosting User owned VMs but please note that
if the<br>Hypervisor hosting your VM fails we have NO spares and will NOT attempt anything beyond basic repair work,
<br>in this case you will suffer the total loss of your VM.

Failure to comply with this notice will eventually lead to Hardware being turned off and disposed of, whether it<br>
is still hosting VMs or not, eventually we will have no choice. Routine reminders will follow and increase in
frequency over the coming weeks.

If you have any concerns with this notice or require clarification or support, please get in touch with the
Cloud Ops Team directly by replying to this message, or by raising a ticket with STFC Cloud Support at
cloud-support@stfc.ac.uk
