# Disable various warnings:
# C0114: Missing module string - we don't need module strings for the small repo
# C0115: Missing class doc string - a lot of the actions are self explanatory
# W0511: TODOs they're well....to do later
# R0801: Similar lines - Imports and method signatures will flag this, such as forwarding action args
# C0116: Missing method docstring - Adds too much noise
# R0917: Too many positional arguments - This will always be a problem for the functions in the workflow module
#    - due to the way stackstorm is designed
# R0913: Too many arguments - same as above
