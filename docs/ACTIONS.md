# Workflows
The following are orquesta workflow actions that are currently implemented.

NOTE: We have decided not to use orquesta going forward - mainly due to the difficulty with testing and
recovery - these workflows will be deprecated in favor of actions that do the same thing.

If you're a user, this won't affect you - we'll ensure that an action is created to replace any workflow we deprecate .


## Project workflows

## Email Workflows (Deprecated)

The following are email workflows that are deprecated and need to be rewritten to use the
Query Library

## Query Library (WIP)

The following are actions that use the query library.
- allows for more refined and complex searches than what openstack currently allows
- uses the `queryopenstack` library: see usage here: <link to queryopestack git>

- additional functionality to query other openstack resources needs to be added to Query Library
- more bespoke and complex query actions will also be written

The following are openstack list actions

NOTE: These actions are deprecated and need to be rewritten to use the Query Library

Each list action will be converted into actions similar to Query Library Actions:
- i.e. `floating.ip.list` will become `floating.ip.search.by.property`, `floating_ip.search.by.regex` etc
