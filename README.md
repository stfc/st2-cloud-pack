### Connecting To Openstack
Openstack openrc config file is required for this pack to work.

The openrc file must be stored in any of these locations (on the VM or host running StackStorm):
 - `/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml`
 - `/home/<user>/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml`

see how to install StackStorm here: https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/

Install the pack like so:
`st2 pack install https://github.com/stfc/st2-cloud-pack`


### Pack Configuration

You can either:

- Copy the configuration in [stackstorm_openstack.yaml.example](https://github.com/stfc/st2-cloud-pack/blob/main/stackstorm_openstack.yaml.example) to `/opt/stackstorm/configs/stackstorm_openstack.yaml` and change the values to work for you.


- Run `st2 pack config stackstorm_openstack` on your host after installation to use the stackstorm config script and follow the instructions
