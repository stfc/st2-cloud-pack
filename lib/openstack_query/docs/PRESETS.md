# Query Presets

Presets define how the query filters results when using the `where()` command

Presets define what query to run, they must be as atomic as possible - e.g. `EQUAL_TO`, `NOT_EQUAL_TO`, etc.
This allows the query to be defined by multiple presets and makes it clear what you want the query to find.

**Example:** To find all servers in a list of projects which are shutoff or errored - the queries can be:
```python
q1 = ServerQuery().where(preset=ANY_IN, prop=project_id, values=["project1", "project2"])
q2 = q1.where(preset=ANY_IN, prop=server_status, values=["ERROR", "SHUTOFF"])
```

Presets are stored as enums. There are currently the following enum classes:

| Preset Class                                  | Description                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [QueryPresetsGeneric](#QueryPresetsGeneric)   | Used to hold presets that can be applied to any property (no matter the type)       |
| [QueryPresetsString](#QueryPresetsString)     | Used to hold presets that can only be applied to string-type properties             |
| [QueryPresetsInteger](#QueryPresetsInteger)   | Used to hold presets that can only be applied to integer-type properties            |
| [QueryPresetsDateTime](#QueryPresetsDateTime) | Used to hold presets that can only be applied to properties that hold datetime info |

# Adding New Presets

**NOTE:** Be careful about making new presets - think about if itâ€™s needed.
**Add new presets only if you think it required**

Presets are grouped based on data types they work on - current groups are:

- `QueryPresetsGeneric` - presets that should work on all properties of any type
- `QueryPresetsString` - presets that should work on string properties only
- `QueryPresetsInteger` - presets that should work on integer properties only
- `QueryPresetsDateTime` - presets that should work on datetime related properties only (those which hold timestamps)


Evaluate what datatypes you want your preset to work on - and assign them to one of the groups above.
- you can add a new group if your preset doesn't belong to any of the groups above (see Adding Preset Group below)

## Adding a Preset to a Group

#### **1. Add the preset name to the corresponding enum class in `/lib/enums/query/query_presets.py`**

e.g.
```python
class QueryPresetsGeneric(QueryPresets):
    """
    Enum class which holds generic query comparison operators
    """

    EQUAL_TO = auto()
    ...
    NEW_PRESET = auto() # <- we add this line to repesent a new preset enum belonging to the 'Generic' group
```

#### **2. Edit the corresponding handler class in `/lib/openstack_query/handlers/client_side_handler_<preset-group>.py`.**

Here you must:
- add a 'client-side' filter function as a method
- add the mapping between the enum and filter function in self._filter_functions.

The filter function must:
- **take as input at least one parameter - `prop`**:
  - `prop` (must be the first positional argument) - represents the property value the filter acts on.
  - Can also take other parameters are extra arguments that are required for the preset to work
- **return a boolean**
   - `True` if the prop passes filter
   - `False` if not

e.g. editing `client_side_handler_generic.py`
```python
class ClientSideHandlerGeneric(ClientSideHandler):
...

def __init__(self, filter_function_mappings: PresetPropMappings):
   super().__init__(filter_function_mappings)

   self._filter_functions = {
       QueryPresetsGeneric.EQUAL_TO: self._prop_equal_to,
       ...
       QueryPresetsGeneric.NEW_PRESET: self._new_preset_filter_func # <- 2) add the enum-to-function mapping
   }

...

def _new_preset_filter_func(self, prop: Any, arg1, arg2):
   """
   A new preset filter - takes a property value, performs some logic and returns a boolean if
   property passes a filter or not
   :param prop: property value to check
   :param arg1: some arg the filter uses
   :param arg2: some other arg the filter uses
   :returns: True or False
   """
   ... # Define your preset logic here
```

#### **3. Edit the query class mappings for each Query class you wish to use the preset in**
Each Query Class has a set of mappings which configures certain aspects of the Query (See [FILTER_MAPPINGS.md](FILTER_MAPPINGS.md) for details).

One of these aspects is which preset-property pair can be used together when calling `where()` on the class.

Here you must:
1. Evaluate which Query class should be able to use your new preset
2. For each Query class you've chosen, evaluate which property(ies) the preset should work on
3. Add chosen mappings to `get_client_side_handlers` method in the Mappings class for each chosen Query
   - these are located in `mappings/<query-resource>_mapping.py`

e.g. Adding Mappings for `QueryPresetsGeneric.NEW_PRESET` to `ServerQuery`. Editing `mappings/server_mapping.py`
```python

class ServerMapping(MappingInterface):
    ...

    @staticmethod
    def get_client_side_handlers() -> ServerSideHandler:
        ...
        return QueryClientSideHandlers(
            # set generic query preset mappings
            generic_handler=ClientSideHandlerGeneric(
                {
                    # Line below maps EQUAL_TO preset on all available properties
                    # ["*"] - represents all props
                    QueryPresetsGeneric.EQUAL_TO: ["*"],
                    ...
                    # Line below maps our 'new preset' to two properties which the preset can run on
                    # Running the preset on any other property leads to an error
                    QueryPresetsGeneric.NEW_PRESET: [
                        ServerProperties.SERVER_ID,
                        ServerProperties.SERVER_NAME
                    ]
                }
            ),
        )
    ...
```

#### **4. (Optional) Add server-side filters for the preset**

'server-side' filters are a set of kwargs that can be passed to the openstacksdk command to run the query server-side.
    - Rather than getting all available resources and running the filter through this package (via client-side filter functions)

If you're adding a query preset which can be done via an openstacksdk command, adding server-side filter configuration will
make use of openstacksdk query functionality. This has several benefits:
1. Query runs quicker - since the query is handled at the database side
2. Less calls to Openstacksdk than using client-side filters - since we don't need to get all resources

Query Library will use server-side method of querying over client-side if available.

To add a server-side filter you must:
1. Read the Openstack API documentation for each Query the preset works on
    - links to the specific docs can be found in the docstring of `get_server_side_handler` method for the query
      - located in `mappings/<query-resource>_mapping.py`

2. Once a server-side filter is discovered for your new preset add a mapping to `get_server_side_handler` method

e.g. Adding server-side mapping for `QueryPresetsGeneric.NEW_PRESET` to `ServerQuery`. Editing `mappings/server_mapping.py`
```python

class ServerMapping(MappingInterface):
    ...

    @staticmethod
    def get_server_side_handler() -> ServerSideHandler:
        ...
        return ServerSideHandler(
            {
                QueryPresetsGeneric.NEW_PRESET: {
                    # adding a server-side mapping for NEW_PRESET when given SERVER_ID
                    ServerProperties.SERVER_ID: lambda value, arg1, arg2:
                        {"server-side-kwarg": value, "server-side-arg1": arg1, "server-side-arg2": arg2}
                }
            }
    ...
```

### **Adding a new preset group**

As stated above - presets are grouped based on the datatype of the property the act on. If you need another preset
group - you can add one like so:

1. Create a new preset group class in `/lib/enums/query/query_presets.py`
    - it inherits from base class QueryPresets


2. Create new client side handler in `/lib/openstack_query/handlers/client_side_handler_<preset>.py`
   - it inherits from base class `ClientSideHandler` - `/lib/openstack_query/handlers/client_side_handler.py`.


3. Add your preset as a attribute in query_client_side_handlers dataclass
   - located in `/lib/structs/query/query_client_side_handlers.py`


4. Follow steps mentioned above to add new presets to the new preset group class you've created
